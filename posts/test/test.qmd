Suppose you have a new programming language called `Fomo` that is just like Python, _except_ you can define functions with `fomo` in addition to `def`.  For example, consider this Python code:

```python

import numpy 

def hello_world():
    "An example"
    pass
```

```python


def test(x):
  sqrt(6)
  return 1+1
    
def test():
  pass
    

```


```bash
quarto pandoc --list-highlight-languages
ls -h /
cd ..
```
