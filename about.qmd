Hi! My name is Manuel and I am living in Switzerland. I have graduated in physics and currently I am working in IT. In this blog, I occasionally write about my hobby projects. Usually, you can expect to read about riddles, physics, electronics, math or computer science.

You can reach me via [email](mailto:mu2718@proton.me).

In case you are wondering about the nickname as well: For sure it's just some greek letters and math related sequences... ðŸ˜€

If you like my articles and you want to encourage me: <script type='text/javascript' src='https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/widget/Widget_2.js'></script><script type='text/javascript'>kofiwidget2.init('Support me on Ko-Fi', '#29abe0', 'E1E2S1R39');kofiwidget2.draw();</script>
