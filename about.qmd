Hi! My name is Manuel and I am living in Switzerland. I have graduated in physics and currently I am working in IT. In this blog, I occasionally write about my hobby projects. Usually, you can expect to read about riddles, physics, electronics, math or computer science.

In case you are wondering about the nickname: One possible interpretation identifies 'mu' being the greek letter Î¼ and 2718 the sequence of Euler's number *e*. Therefore mu2718 could stand for *Î¼e*, or in latin letters 'me' ðŸ™‚
